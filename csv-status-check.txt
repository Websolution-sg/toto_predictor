CSV FILE ANALYSIS
=================

Current CSV Status:
- First line (latest): 22,25,29,31,34,43,11
- Second line: 9,24,31,34,43,44,1  
- Total lines: 109

The CSV appears to be correctly updated with:
✅ Latest TOTO result: 22, 25, 29, 31, 34, 43, 11
✅ Proper format: 6 main numbers + 1 additional number
✅ Placed at top of file (most recent first)
✅ Previous results maintained in order

Please specify what exactly appears incorrect:
1. Are you seeing different numbers?
2. Are numbers in wrong order?
3. Is the website showing old results?
4. Are there formatting issues?
5. Is the file missing entries?

Current expected format:
22,25,29,31,34,43,11  ← Latest (Aug 16, 2025)
9,24,31,34,43,44,1   ← Previous (Aug 12, 2025)
... (historical results follow)

What specifically needs to be fixed?
